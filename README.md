### Food Delivery challenge solution

Each branch of the repository represents a snapshot of the codebase during the two-day progression.

In the current `optionals-day-two` branch, the implemented user actions are:

- [X] As an employee, I can log in
- [X] As a manager, I can add a new meal
- [X] As a manager, I can list all the meals
- [X] As a manager, I can edit an existing meal
- [X] As a manager, I can delete an existing meal
- [X] As a manager, I can add a new customer
- [X] As a manager, I can list all the customers
- [X] As a manager, I can edit an existing customer
- [X] As a manager, I can delete an existing customer
- [X] As a manager, I can add a new order
- [X] As a manager, I can list all the undelivered orders
- [X] As a manager, I can edit an existing order
- [X] As a manager, I can delete an existing order
- [X] As a delivery guy, I can mark one of my orders as delivered
- [X] As a delivery guy, I list all my undelivered orders

The repositories have been refactored using inheritance.
